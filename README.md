## About Me & My Goals

My name is Lingfeng He, and I am currently pursuing my doctorate at the Institute for Empirical Social Science Research (IESSR), Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University (XJTU). I plan to obtain my Ph.D. degree in Sociology in June 2026. 

As a member of the academic community, I am committed to improving the standardization of the research process and reducing the difficulties of reproducibility of research results. Therefore, I devote my efforts to office automation and workflow of data analysis. As a sociological researcher, my long-cherished wish is to eliminate digital barriers to technology use, and consequently, increase the possibility of upward social mobility. For this reason, I am dedicated to writing and translating technical books that are easy to understand and designing visualized data analysis programs that are easy to use.  

## About My Research

My research interests lie in social networks, social computation, and informatization-driven translational medicine.  I am currently engaged in several research programs. They are on:

- social eating, with the most recent publication entitled [Social Eating as a Favor Exchange Facilitator: New Survey Evidence from China](https://lingfenghe.com/research/f/publication-in-economic-sociology-perspectives-conversations);
- urban computing, with the most recent conference paper entitled [Sensing the Environmental Inequality of PM2.5 Exposure Using Fine-Scale Measurements of Social Strata and Citizenship Identity](https://lingfenghe.com/research/f/publication-in-isprs-international-journal-of-geo-information);
- international trade resilience, with the most recent publication entitled [Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity in the International Trade Resilience during COVID-19](https://lingfenghe.com/research/f/publication-in-applied-geography-1);
- deep-learning based radiomics, with the most recent preprint entitled [Reconsideration Reproducibility of Currently Deep Learning-Based Radiomics: Taking Renal Cell Carcinoma as an Example](https://lingfenghe.com/research/f/preprint-about-deep-learning-radiomics-reproducibility-at-ssrn).
