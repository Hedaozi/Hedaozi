## About Me

Greetings! My name is Lingfeng He, and I am currently pursuing my doctorate at the Institute for Empirical Social Science Research (IESSR), Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University (XJTU). My research interests are in social networks, social computation, and informatization-driven translational medicine. I am currently engaged in a research program on social eating, and my most recent publication is *Social Eating as a Favor Exchange Facilitator: New Survey Evidence from China* ([Bian & He, 2022](https://econsoc.mpifg.de/46126/04_Bian_He_23-3_July2022.pdf)).

As a member of the academic community, I am committed to improving the standardization of the research process and reducing the difficulties of reproducibility of research results. Therefore, I devote my efforts to office automation and workflow of data analysis. As a sociological researcher, my long-cherished wish is to eliminate digital barriers to technology use, and consequently, increase the possibility of upward social mobility. For this reason, I am dedicated to writing and translating technical books that are easy to understand and designing visualized data analysis programs that are easy to use.
