## About Me

Hi! I am Lingfeng He, a doctoral student at Institute for Empirical Social Science Research (IESSR), Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University (XJTU). My research interests lie in social networks, social stratification and mobility, digital inequality, social change, quantitative research methods, and computational social sciences. I am now working on a research program on social eating. My most recent publication is *Social Eating as a Favor Exchange Facilitator: New Survey Evidence from China* (Bian & He, 2022). 

As a member of the academic community, I develop for improving the standardization of research process and reduce the difficulty of reproducibility of research results. Thus, you can see me working on office automation and workflow of data analysis. As a sociological researcher, I have a long-cherished wish to eliminate digital barriers to technology use, and resultingly increase the possibility of upward social mobility. That's why I am committed to writing and translating easy-understand technical books and designing easy-to-use visualized data-analysis programs.
